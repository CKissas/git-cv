    My home lab leverages Proxmox OS to host a fleet of VMs and LXC containers,
    with pfSense securing and managing the network. Home Assistant drives
    intelligent automations, while Netbird, Cloudflared, and SSH provide secure
    remote access. Data lives in PostgreSQL and MariaDB, monitored by Prometheus
    and visualized through Grafana dashboards. I experiment with new
    technologies and services, testing integrations and workflows in a safe,
    controlled environment. The lab also supports performance tuning, backup
    strategies, and hands-on development of scripts and automation routines.
    This setup allows me to continuously refine my skills in virtualization,
    networking, and full-stack system monitoring.
